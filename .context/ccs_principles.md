# Core Development Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the fundamental principles and standards that guide our development practices. These principles are designed to create maintainable, reliable, and scalable software systems while promoting clear communication and efficient development practices.

## Core Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Tests are first-class citizens and should be written before implementation
- Testing code is equally important as production code
- Tests drive design decisions and architecture
- Every feature starts with a test that defines its behavior
- Prefer Jest for TypeScript projects due to its comprehensive tooling and parallelization capabilities

### 2. Code Quality and Maintainability

#### Clear and Explicit Naming

- Prefer long, descriptive names over brevity
- No abbreviations except for established domain terms
- No single-letter variables (except for mathematical operations or standard loop iterators)
- Allowed: tagged prefixes for organizational purposes (e.g., `t_` for types)

#### Documentation

- Minimize comments through clear naming and structure
- Comments should explain "why" not "what" when needed
- Appropriate uses for comments:
  - Nuanced explanations of complex algorithms
  - TODO/FIXME tags for tracking technical debt
  - API documentation for public interfaces

### 3. System Properties

#### Reliability

- Systems must maintain consistent behavior under load
- Error handling must be comprehensive and graceful
- All edge cases should be considered and tested
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

#### Scalability

- Consider Big O notation in algorithm design
- Design for horizontal scaling capabilities
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- Monitor and optimize performance bottlenecks

#### Maintainability

- Follow SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Open/Closed Principle
  - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - Interface Segregation Principle
  - Dependency Inversion Principle
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Maintain backwards compatibility when extending functionality
- Regular refactoring to improve code quality

### 4. Development Workflow

#### Version Control

- Meaningful commit messages
- Feature branches for all changes
- Regular integration with main branch
- Code review required for all changes

#### Continuous Integration

- Automated testing on all commits
- Static code analysis
- Type checking enforcement
- Build verification

## Implementation Guidelines

### TypeScript Usage

- Strict type checking enabled
- Interfaces for dependency injection
- No `any` types except in test files
- Proper use of generics for reusable components

### Error Handling

- Custom error classes for domain-specific errors
- Error hierarchies for categorization
- Proper stack trace preservation
- Consistent error messaging format

### Code Organization

- Feature-based folder structure
- Co-located test files
- Shared utilities in dedicated modules
- Clear separation of concerns

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Code Quality Metrics

- Test coverage requirements
- Complexity thresholds
- Dependencies audit
- Performance benchmarks

### Runtime Monitoring

- Error rates and patterns
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- User behavior analytics

## For AI Systems

```yaml
ai_implementation:
  priorities:
    - Test creation before implementation
    - Type safety and explicit typing
    - Clear naming over comments
    - SOLID principle adherence

  naming_conventions:
    style: "explicit-descriptive"
    patterns:
      - "PascalCase for types/interfaces"
      - "camelCase for variables/functions"
      - "UPPER_CASE for constants"

  code_organization:
    structure: "feature-based"
    testing: "co-located"
    utilities: "shared-modules"

  type_safety:
    strictness: "maximum"
    exceptions: "test-files-only"
```

## Versioning

This document follows semantic versioning:

- MAJOR version for incompatible changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible additions
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible fixes
