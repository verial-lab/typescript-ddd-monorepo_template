## What is Apache Kafka?

[↑](#table-of-contents)

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log.

## Key Features and Benefits

[↑](#table-of-contents)

### 1. High Throughput and Low Latency

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Capable of handling millions of messages per second
- Sub-millisecond latency when properly configured
- Linear scalability by adding more brokers to the cluster

### 2. Durability and Reliability

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Messages are persisted on disk and replicated across multiple brokers
- Configurable retention policies (time-based or size-based)
- Exactly-once semantics available for stream processing

### 3. Distributed Architecture

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Horizontally scalable with multiple brokers forming a cluster
- Topics can be partitioned across brokers for parallel processing
- Automatic leader election for partitions when a broker fails

### 4. Event Streaming Capabilities

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Real-time data pipelines
- Stream processing with Kafka Streams or KSQL
- Change data capture (CDC) for database events

### 5. Ecosystem Integration

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Connect API for integrating with external systems
- Extensive library of pre-built connectors
- Compatible with most programming languages and frameworks

## When to Use Kafka with Our Event Bus

[↑](#table-of-contents)

Kafka is an excellent choice for our event bus implementation when:

1. **High throughput is required**: Applications generating thousands of events per second
2. **Event replay is important**: The ability to replay events from a specific point in time
3. **Event sourcing patterns**: When implementing event sourcing for your domain
4. **Microservices communication**: As a backbone for asynchronous communication between services
5. **Analytics and monitoring**: When events need to be processed for analytics or monitoring

## Setup and Configuration

[↑](#table-of-contents)

### Local Development Setup

[↑](#table-of-contents)

1. **Using Docker Compose**:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
  
  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
```

2. **Using Kafka CLI**:

```bash
# Start Zookeeper
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# Start Kafka
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# Create a topic
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```

### Connecting with Our Event Bus

[↑](#table-of-contents)

```typescript
import { createKafkaEventBus } from '@repo-packages/i_event-bus';

const eventBus = createKafkaEventBus({
  clientId: 'my-service',
  brokers: ['localhost:9092'],
  groupId: 'my-service-group'
});

await eventBus.connect();
```

## Production Recommendations

[↑](#table-of-contents)

### Small Applications (1-5 services)

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- **Cluster Size**: 3 brokers
- **Partitioning**: Start with 3-5 partitions per topic
- **Replication Factor**: 3 (for fault tolerance)
- **Monitoring**: Basic JMX metrics with Prometheus
- **Deployment**: Single region, managed service recommended

```typescript
// Configuration for small applications
const eventBus = createKafkaEventBus({
  clientId: 'my-service',
  brokers: ['kafka-1:9092', 'kafka-2:9092', 'kafka-3:9092'],
  groupId: 'my-service-group'
});
```

### Medium Applications (5-20 services)

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- **Cluster Size**: 5-7 brokers
- **Partitioning**: 10-20 partitions per topic
- **Replication Factor**: 3
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- **Deployment**: Consider multi-AZ within a single region
- **Topic Management**: Implement topic naming conventions and lifecycle management

```typescript
// Configuration for medium applications
const eventBus = createKafkaEventBus({
  clientId: 'my-service',
  brokers: ['kafka-1:9092', 'kafka-2:9092', 'kafka-3:9092', 'kafka-4:9092', 'kafka-5:9092'],
  groupId: 'my-service-group',
  // Additional KafkaJS configuration can be added here
});
```

### Large Applications (20+ services)

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- **Cluster Size**: 9+ brokers
- **Partitioning**: 30+ partitions per high-volume topic
- **Replication Factor**: 3
- **Monitoring**: Enterprise monitoring solutions
- **Deployment**: Multi-region with MirrorMaker 2 for replication
- **Topic Management**: Automated topic creation and configuration
- **Schema Registry**: Implement schema validation for all events

```typescript
// Configuration for large applications with multi-region setup
const eventBus = createKafkaEventBus({
  clientId: 'my-service',
  brokers: [
    'kafka-region1-1:9092', 'kafka-region1-2:9092', 'kafka-region1-3:9092',
    'kafka-region2-1:9092', 'kafka-region2-2:9092', 'kafka-region2-3:9092'
  ],
  groupId: 'my-service-group',
  // Consider using a custom Kafka client with additional configuration
});
```

## Performance Tuning

[↑](#table-of-contents)

### Producer Optimization

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Batch messages when possible
- Use appropriate compression (snappy or lz4)
- Configure proper `acks` level based on durability needs
- Tune `linger.ms` and `batch.size` for throughput vs latency tradeoff

### Consumer Optimization

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Adjust `fetch.min.bytes` and `fetch.max.wait.ms`
- Configure appropriate `max.poll.records`
- Implement efficient message processing
- Consider parallel processing with multiple consumer instances

## Common Challenges and Solutions

[↑](#table-of-contents)

### Handling Duplicate Events

[↑](#table-of-contents)

Implement idempotent consumers by:

- Using event IDs for deduplication
- Storing processed event IDs
- Making event handlers idempotent

### Dealing with Event Order

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Use single partition for strict ordering
- Design events to be commutative when possible
- Implement application-level sequencing when needed

### Monitoring and Alerting

[↑](#table-of-contents)

Key metrics to monitor:

- Broker CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Under-replicated partitions
- Consumer lag
- Request rate and latency

## Security Considerations

[↑](#table-of-contents)

- Enable SSL/TLS for encryption in transit
- Implement SASL authentication
- Use ACLs for authorization
- Regularly audit access and configurations

```typescript
// Example configuration with security
const eventBus = createKafkaEventBus({
  clientId: 'my-service',
  brokers: ['kafka-1:9092'],
  groupId: 'my-service-group',
  ssl: true,
  sasl: {
    mechanism: 'plain',
    username: 'user',
    password: 'password'
  }
});
```

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular backups of Kafka configurations
- Multi-region replication for critical data
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular disaster recovery testing

By following these recommendations, you can effectively leverage Kafka with our event bus implementation for building robust, scalable, and resilient event-driven systems.
