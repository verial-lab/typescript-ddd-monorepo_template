# RMP-001: CI/CD Pipeline Improvements and Example Website

## Status: ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Priority: ðŸ”¥ Critical

## Category: `infrastructure`, `automation`, `quality`

## Overview

Enhance the CI/CD pipeline reliability and implement an example website for end-to-end deployment testing. This initiative aims to improve the deployment process and provide a reference implementation for users.

## Goals

1. Review and fix current CI/CD pipeline failures
2. Implement an example website for deployment testing
3. Create automated deployment verification
4. Document deployment processes comprehensively

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All CI/CD pipeline tests pass consistently
- [ ] Example website successfully deploys in both local and production environments
- [ ] Automated tests verify deployment success
- [ ] Comprehensive deployment documentation available
- [ ] Clear error handling and troubleshooting guides

## Implementation Steps

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Review

- [ ] Audit current pipeline failures and create issue tracking
- [ ] Identify common failure patterns
- [ ] Implement fixes for identified issues
- [ ] Add better error reporting and logging
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

### 2. Example Website Implementation

- [ ] Create a simple but representative website using the monorepo structure
- [ ] Include common deployment scenarios:
  - [ ] Multiple domains/services
  - [ ] Database migrations
  - [ ] Environment configuration
  - [ ] Static assets
  - [ ] API integrations

### 3. Deployment Automation

- [ ] Create deployment scripts for local environment
- [ ] Implement production deployment automation
- [ ] Add deployment verification tests
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting

### 4. Documentation and Tooling

- [ ] Write comprehensive deployment guides
- [ ] Create troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Implement deployment helper tools
- [ ] Add deployment templates and examples

## Dependencies

- Current CI/CD infrastructure
- Example website codebase
- Deployment environments (staging/production)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Complex deployment scenarios | Start with simple cases, incrementally add complexity |
| Environment-specific issues | Use containerization and environment parity |
| Integration failures | Comprehensive integration testing suite |
| Resource constraints | Clear resource planning and monitoring |

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (CI/CD Review): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Example Website): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3 (Automation): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4 (Documentation): 1-2 weeks
