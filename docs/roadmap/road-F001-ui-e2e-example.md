## Problem Statement

The current codebase lacks a complete reference implementation showing how to properly use the event bus in a real-world scenario. Developers have difficulty understanding how all components should interact in an event-driven architecture from UI to domain and back. Without a clear example, teams waste time reinventing patterns and risk implementing inconsistent solutions.

## Business Impact

A comprehensive example will:
- Reduce onboarding time for new developers by 30-40%
- Improve code consistency across teams by providing a reference implementation
- Speed up feature development by providing reusable patterns
- Reduce technical support requests related to event bus usage
- Lower the risk of architectural drift across different parts of the application

## Proposed Solution

Create an end-to-end example application using the profile domain that demonstrates the complete flow from UI interaction to domain events and back. This example will include:

1. A React UI with authentication and profile management
2. Domain model implementation with proper event publishing
3. Event subscribers and handlers
4. Real-time event visualization to make the invisible event flow visible
5. Comprehensive documentation explaining the architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can log in with a pre-configured account and log out
2. User can create, view, update, and delete their profile
3. All profile actions trigger appropriate events on the event bus
4. Events are visualized in real-time through an event inspector
5. UI updates in response to events from the event bus
6. Code follows project style guidelines and best practices
7. Comprehensive documentation explains the architecture and event flow
8. All unit, integration, and E2E tests pass

## Decision Rationale

Several approaches were considered:

1. **Written documentation only**: Rejected because abstract documentation without a working example would leave too much room for interpretation.

2. **Multiple small examples**: Rejected because it wouldn't show how all the pieces fit together in a cohesive application.

3. **Backend-only example**: Rejected because it wouldn't demonstrate the crucial UI interaction patterns and event-driven UI updates.

4. **Complete example with the profile domain**: Selected because:
   - Profile is a familiar and intuitive domain for all developers
   - It enables demonstrating the full event flow from UI to domain and back
   - It's complex enough to be realistic but simple enough to be understandable
   - It allows demonstrating authentication integration which is a common requirement

## Technical Considerations

- The example should balance simplicity with realism - too simple and it won't be useful, too complex and it won't be understandable
- Need to ensure the event bus performance is demonstrated realistically
- Authentication should be abstracted enough to focus on event patterns
- The event visualization component will need careful design to be both informative and non-intrusive
- The implementation must follow all established coding standards and best practices

## Resources Required

- **Team**: 1 senior developer with React and DDD experience
- **Time**: 4-5 weeks for complete implementation including documentation
- **Dependencies**: Event bus implementation (ROAD-I001), Component library
- **Infrastructure**: None beyond development environments

## Success Metrics

1. Developers can set up and run the example in under 10 minutes
2. Codebase receives 90%+ approval in code reviews
3. 80% of developers report better understanding of event bus patterns after reviewing the example
4. Reduction in event bus related questions in internal support channels
5. New features following the example patterns have 30% fewer bugs related to event handling

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Example becomes too complex | High | Medium | Regular reviews to ensure scope doesn't expand; focus on clarity over comprehensiveness |
| Example diverges from best practices | High | Low | Thorough code reviews; involvement of architecture team |
| Dependency on event bus implementation | Medium | Medium | Build with clear interfaces that can adapt to event bus implementation changes |
| Performance issues in event visualization | Medium | Medium | Performance testing during development; fallback simple visualization mode |
