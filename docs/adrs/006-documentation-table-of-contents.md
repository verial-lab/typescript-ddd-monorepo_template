## Context

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As the project grows, the documentation will expand to cover various aspects of the system. Without a clear organization and navigation structure, it becomes difficult for users to find the information they need. The previous documentation structure established in ADR-005 organized content into logical categories, but lacked a consistent navigation pattern within each section.

We need a standardized approach to organize and present documentation that:

1. Makes it easy for users to discover available documentation
2. Provides a consistent navigation experience across all documentation sections
3. Supports future implementation of a documentation UI
4. Scales well as the documentation grows
5. Facilitates maintenance and updates
6. Reduces time spent scrolling through long documents
7. Improves section discoverability
8. Provides quick navigation back to key points

### Main Table of Contents Structure

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

We will implement a hierarchical table of contents structure for all documentation:

1. The main documentation entry point (`docs/index.md`) will serve as the root table of contents, linking to each major section's index file.

2. Each section's index file (e.g., `docs/development/index.md`) will:
   - Serve as a table of contents for that specific section
   - Organize content into logical subsections
   - Provide links to all documents within that section
   - Include guidelines for adding new documentation to that section

3. The table of contents structure will:
   - Use consistent formatting with clear headings and bullet points
   - Group related documents under appropriate subsections
   - Indicate when no documentation is available in a subsection yet
   - Provide context about the purpose of each subsection

### Navigation Patterns

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Every markdown file over 50 lines must include:

1. Table of Contents:
   - Placed immediately after the introduction
   - Contains links to all H2 and H3 headings
   - Uses markdown reference links
   - Follows consistent indentation (2 spaces)
   - Excludes sections below H3 level

2. Back to Top Links:
   - Added after each major section (H2) and subsection (H3)
   - Uses consistent format: `[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)`
   - Right-aligned where possible
   - Includes parent navigation where relevant

### Implementation Rules

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1. Document Structure:
   - Title (H1)
   - Brief introduction
   - Table of contents
   - Content sections with navigation

2. Navigation Links:
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Place after each H2 and H3 heading
   - Include parent navigation where relevant

3. Formatting:
   - Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
   - Clear section separation
   - Proper heading hierarchy

## Consequences

### Positive

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- Improved navigation and discoverability of documentation
- Consistent user experience across all documentation sections
- Better scalability as the documentation grows
- Support for future implementation of a documentation UI
- Clear guidelines for maintaining and extending documentation
- Reduced cognitive load for users trying to find specific information
- Faster document navigation
- Enhanced productivity through better organization
- Improved readability and accessibility

### Negative

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- Requires additional maintenance to keep tables of contents updated
- Adds some redundancy in navigation structures
- More initial setup time for new documents
- Potential for broken links if not maintained
- Slightly more complex markdown structure

### Neutral

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

- Documentation authors need to be aware of the table of contents structure when adding new content
- May need to adjust the structure as we learn more about user navigation patterns

## Implementation Notes

[↑ Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1. Document Organization:
   - Place files in appropriate directories
   - Update relevant index files when adding new documents
   - Follow established formatting guidelines
   - Consider creating new subsections when needed

2. Tooling Support:
   - Consider markdown linting rules
   - Automate TOC generation where possible
   - Validate navigation links
   - Check formatting consistency

3. Maintenance Guidelines:
   - Periodically review the table of contents structure
   - Update navigation links when reorganizing content
   - Validate changes during documentation updates
   - Monitor user feedback and iterate on patterns

4. Templates and Examples:
   - Provide document templates with pre-configured navigation
   - Include example implementations
   - Document any exceptions to the patterns
   - Share best practices
