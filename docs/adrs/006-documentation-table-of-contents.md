# ADR-006: Documentation Table of Contents Structure

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the project grows, the documentation will expand to cover various aspects of the system. Without a clear organization and navigation structure, it becomes difficult for users to find the information they need. The previous documentation structure established in ADR-005 organized content into logical categories, but lacked a consistent navigation pattern within each section.

We need a standardized approach to organize and present documentation that:

1. Makes it easy for users to discover available documentation
2. Provides a consistent navigation experience across all documentation sections
3. Supports future implementation of a documentation UI
4. Scales well as the documentation grows
5. Facilitates maintenance and updates

## Decision

We will implement a hierarchical table of contents structure for all documentation:

1. The main documentation entry point (`docs/index.md`) will serve as the root table of contents, linking to each major section's index file.

2. Each section's index file (e.g., `docs/development/index.md`) will:
   - Serve as a table of contents for that specific section
   - Organize content into logical subsections
   - Provide links to all documents within that section
   - Include guidelines for adding new documentation to that section

3. The table of contents structure will:
   - Use consistent formatting with clear headings and bullet points
   - Group related documents under appropriate subsections
   - Indicate when no documentation is available in a subsection yet
   - Provide context about the purpose of each subsection

4. All documentation files will be referenced from at least one table of contents to ensure discoverability.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved navigation and discoverability of documentation
- Consistent user experience across all documentation sections
- Better scalability as the documentation grows
- Support for future implementation of a documentation UI
- Clear guidelines for maintaining and extending documentation
- Reduced cognitive load for users trying to find specific information

### Negative

- Requires additional maintenance to keep tables of contents updated
- Adds some redundancy in navigation structures
- May require periodic reorganization as the documentation evolves

### Neutral

- Documentation authors need to be aware of the table of contents structure when adding new content
- May need to adjust the structure as we learn more about user navigation patterns

## Implementation Notes

1. All index files should follow a consistent format:
   - Start with a brief introduction about the section
   - Include a "Table of Contents" section with subsections
   - List documents with descriptive links
   - Provide guidelines for adding new documentation

2. When adding new documentation:
   - Place the file in the appropriate directory
   - Update the relevant index file to include a link to the new document
   - Ensure the document follows established formatting guidelines
   - Consider whether the new document warrants a new subsection in the table of contents

3. Periodically review the table of contents structure to ensure it remains effective and usable as the documentation grows.
