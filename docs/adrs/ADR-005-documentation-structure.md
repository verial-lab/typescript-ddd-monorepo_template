# ADR-005: Documentation Structure

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the project grows, the need for organized and accessible documentation becomes increasingly important. Without a clear structure, documentation can become scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to find, leading to confusion and reduced productivity.

We need to establish a documentation structure that:

- Organizes content logically by purpose and audience
- Makes it easy to find relevant information
- Scales as the project grows
- Supports both template-level documentation and project-specific documentation
- Maintains consistency in formatting and style
- Can be easily navigated through a UI in the future

## Decision

We have decided to organize the documentation into the following structure:

```
docs/
├── index.md                 # Main table of contents
├── development/             # Development workflows, tools, and practices
│   ├── index.md             # Development table of contents
│   └── linting-and-formatting.md
├── technical/               # Technical documentation about architecture and implementation
│   └── index.md             # Technical documentation table of contents
├── guides/                  # Step-by-step guides for common tasks
│   └── index.md             # Guides table of contents
└── adrs/                    # Architectural Decision Records
    ├── index.md             # ADRs table of contents
    ├── 001-typescript-module-resolution-strategy.md
    ├── 002-code-organization-and-style-guide.md
    ├── 003-build-system-configuration-with-tsup.md
    ├── 004-monorepo-structure-and-workspace-organization.md
    └── 005-documentation-structure.md
```

Each section serves a specific purpose:

1. **Development Documentation**: Information related to development workflows, tools, and practices. This includes documentation on linting, formatting, testing, and other development processes.

2. **Technical Documentation**: Detailed technical information about the architecture and implementation details. This includes documentation on the codebase structure, design patterns, and technical decisions.

3. **Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for common tasks. These are practical, hands-on guides that help users accomplish specific goals.

4. **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**: Documentation of significant architectural decisions, including context, decision, and consequences.

Each directory contains an `index.md` file that serves as a table of contents for that section, with documents categorized into logical groups. This structure allows for:

1. Easy navigation through a hierarchical structure
2. Logical grouping of related documents
3. Future implementation of a documentation UI that can parse the table of contents structure
4. Clear organization that scales as the project grows

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear organization makes it easier to find relevant documentation
- Separation by purpose helps target different audiences (developers, architects, etc.)
- Structure scales well as the project grows
- Consistent approach to documentation improves maintainability
- Table of contents structure provides quick navigation to relevant content
- Structure supports future implementation of a documentation UI

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain the structure as the project evolves
- May require occasional reorganization as documentation grows
- Additional overhead in creating and maintaining index files

### Neutral

- Documentation will need to be updated as the project evolves
- Contributors will need to be familiar with the documentation structure
