# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the TypeScript DDD Monorepo Template. This documentation is organized into a hierarchical table of contents structure to help you find the information you need quickly and easily.

## Table of Contents

- [**Development Documentation**](./development/index.md) - Development workflows, tools, and practices
- [**Technical Documentation**](./technical/index.md) - Architecture and implementation details
- [**Guides**](./guides/index.md) - Step-by-step guides for common tasks
- [**Architectural Decision Records**](./adrs/index.md) - Documentation of significant architectural decisions

## About This Documentation

This documentation follows a structured table of contents approach, designed to be:

- **Organized by purpose** - Content is grouped into logical categories
- **Easily navigable** - Each section has its own table of contents
- **Scalable** - The structure can accommodate new documentation as the project grows
- **Consistent** - All sections follow the same organizational pattern
- **UI-ready** - The structure supports future implementation of a documentation UI

For more information about the documentation organization, see:

- [ADR-006: Documentation Table of Contents Structure](./adrs/006-documentation-table-of-contents.md)
